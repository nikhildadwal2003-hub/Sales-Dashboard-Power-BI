# Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights.

The dashboard analyzes orders, returns, profit, discounts, and customer segments across multiple regions and product categories. It leverages advanced DAX calculations such as YTD/MTD sales, YoY growth, profit margin, sales targets, and return rates.

Key visualizations include funnel charts, gauge charts, stacked bar charts, donut charts, and geo-maps, enabling stakeholders to track performance, identify high-growth areas, monitor return patterns, and optimize sales strategies.
